# Customer_Segmentation using Machine Learning

## Introduction

In this customer segmentation project, we utilized the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics. Initially, we loaded a dataset containing various customer attributes and employed the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) by analyzing the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS). After identifying k as 5, we trained the K-means model and successfully segmented the customers into five clusters. This segmentation allows for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences, enhancing overall business efficiency and customer satisfaction.
